        <b>What is the Pacebi Alliance?</b><br>
        The Pacebi Alliance (often just shortend to Pacebi) is an open GRSM safe space for everyone. We exclude exclusionists.<br><br>

        <b>Where is the name from?</b><br>
        "Pacebi" is a blend of "pan", "ace", and "bi". It is pronounced /pˈɛɪsbˌaɪ/ <i>PAYS-bye</i>.<br><br>

        <b>I hear you all want to invade Denmark. What is this about?</b><br>
        Pacebi was created after a joke between several GRSM communities wanting to invade the Nordic countries. Don't worry, we aren't actually invading anywhere <s>yet</s>.<br><br>

        <b>GRSM?</b><br>
        GRSM is an initialism for Gender, Romantic, and Sexual orientation Minority. We use it over LGBTQIA+ as it is more concise and inclusive.<br><br>

        <b>I have an issue. How can I contact you?</b><br>
        In-server issues can go to tickets. For general questions, go to the Tumblr page. For serious ones, email the owner at daysant@proton.me.<br>
